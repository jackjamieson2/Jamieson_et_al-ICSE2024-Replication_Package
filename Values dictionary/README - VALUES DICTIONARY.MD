values_dictionary.json comprises the values dictionary used in our analysis, as described in Section 3.2.1.

The dictionary is slightly modified from a dictionary published alongside previous research. The modifications are described in the paper (3.2.1):

Jamieson, J., Foong, Eureka, & Yamashita, Naomi. (2022). Maintaining Values: Navigating Diverse Perspectives in Value-Charged Discussions in Open Source Development. Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 6(CSCW2), 481:1-481:28. https://doi.org/10.1145/3555550

That dictionary was, in turn, modified from another previous study:

Obie, H. O., Hussain, W., Xia, X., Grundy, J., Li, L., Turhan, B., Whittle, J., & Shahin, M. (2021). A First Look at Human Values-Violation in App Reviews. 2021 IEEE/ACM 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Society (ICSE-SEIS), 29–38. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-SEIS52602.2021.0001
